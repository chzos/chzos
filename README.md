<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p>
  Hello, world. Iâ€™m @chzos ðŸ‘‹. I create apps, and SaaS products.<br>
  Iâ€™m currently studying JavaScript, Ruby, and Dart.<br>
  In my free time I use the Godot Engine to build 2D games.
</p>

<h1>What do I do?</h1>
<p>
  Like all software developers, I want to change the world and leave a lasting positive impact on society.
</p>

<h1>When will I stop coding?</h1>
Eyes don't last forever, and maybe my intellect and focus may decline even before my sight. My exit plan from coding and direct development is scheduled for 25 years from now (sometime between 2050-2055). However, I plan to continue to be involved with the internet and technology, in some capacity, for the rest of my life.

<h1>Where am I from?</h1>
I'm from Earth, silly!

<h1>Why did I become a coder?</h1>
<p>
  Because it is the closest thing to magic!
